Goals for the Maven Toys Project

Maven Toys is a toy company that is located primarily in Mexico, and has been saoling toys for about two years. The owners are wanting to know how their sales are going for this two year period. They are looking for several key analysis points, so that they can see how they should adjust their business strategy. 
The following is a list of they key analysis points that they are wanting to see. 

- Toy sales in terms of units sold per product, revenue per product, and the cost per product. 
- Finding the total profit per product by using the revenue and cost. 
- Looking at revenue, cost, and profit by the city the store is located in. 
- Lokking at revenue, cost, and profit, by the type of location the store is at. 
- Looking at the revenue based on the toy categories. 
- Looking at the cost based on the toy categories. 

In order to complete the requests that the owners have made, I will be using SQL to get the metrics for the metrics that they are looking for. 

- I will load the necessary CSV files that were given to me into MySQL Studio. 
- I will clean the data in order to ensure that it is uniform, and check for any null values. 
- After cleaning and transforming the data, I will move on to the anlaysis of the data. 
- I will be providing recommendations and an interactive dashboard for the analyzed data. I will be using Power BI for the data visualization.
